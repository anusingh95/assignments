ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION BY ANU KUMARI


For my assignment, I completed it in two ways. First, I used Jupyter, where I imported the spreadsheet into pandas and completed the tasks using pandas dataframes, which was easy because the data was already in a spreadsheet format. Second, I used an online SQL compiler called SQLiteOnline.com. For this, I had to write code to convert the spreadsheet into a database format, upload it to the website, and then use SQL to complete the tasks. All necessary files for the assignments can be found under this link: https://github.com/anusingh95/assignments. This includes files for both approaches used in completing the tasks
